This is piece is supposed to focus on the fact that Duke revolves around basketball (at least in the spring). Inspired by my last piece and by the fact that I was able to secure a white tent for the UNC game, I wanted this piece to reflect the emotions, sights, and sounds of Cameron Indoor. The different Duke emblems are centered around a rotating basketball, hoping to show the effect of basketball on the school. As you hover your mouse over the Duke logos, different chants pop up at the bottom of the screen that you would hear in Cameron. Finally, I added the flashing white sparkles in order to show the electricity and energy felt in Cameron. The intended audience would be anyone who wants to gather what it is like to experience Duke basketball but unlike the last piece, it focuses more on the sensation than just visual aspects. I also made this focus more on Duke than basketball because this is the concept that I wanted feelings to focus on for this piece. I did this by adding more Duke imagery and Duke colors. 

In order to experience the full effect of this piece, you should be able to see the ball spinning, the white rectangles flashing, and be able to play with the interactivity of the Duke icons.
